# Requirements

### 4W'S and 1H

* What: Sensors that estimate volumetric water content.

* why: To estimate the amount of stored water in the soil horizon.

* When: Agricultural and horticultural applications include irrigation planning, climatic research, and environmental science applications such as solute transport studies and as auxiliary sensors for soil respiration assessments.

* Where: Watershed characterization, irrigation scheduling, greenhouse management, fertigation management, plant ecology, water balance research, microbial ecology, plant disease forecasting, soil respiration, hydrology, and soil health monitoring.

* How: Pin-type metres use the board as an element in a circuit by driving two pins or electrodes into it, based on the notion of electrical resistance.

# SWOT Analysis

* Strength: The deposition of thick soot and tar in chimneys and liners can be caused by burning damp wood.

* Weakness: It necessitates the use of a soil probe. The data collection and measurement methods also necessitate human effort.

* Opportunities: Helpful tool for growing any plant

* Threats: Self-life , production ,quality
